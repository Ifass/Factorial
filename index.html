        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Instead of calculating a factorial one digit at a time, use this calculator to calculate the factorial n! of a number n. Enter an integer, up to 5 digits long. You will get the long integer answer and also the scientific notation for large factorials. You may want to copy the long integer answer result and paste it into another document to view it.</p>

        <h2>Factorial Formula</h2>
        <p><strong>n!</strong> = n × (n - 1) × (n - 2) × (n - 3) × ... × 1</p>

        <p>For example:</p>
        <p><strong>Factorial of 10</strong><br>
        10! = 10 × 9 × 8 × 7 × 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 3,628,800</p>

        <p>By definition, the factorial of 0 is 1: <strong>0!</strong> = 1</p>

        <h2>What is a Factorial?</h2>
        <p>A factorial is a function that multiplies a number by every number below it. For example, <strong>5!</strong> = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120. The function is used, among other things, to find the number of ways “n” objects can be arranged.</p>

        <h2>Factorial Examples</h2>
        <p>There are n! ways of arranging n distinct objects into an ordered sequence.</p>
        <p><strong>n</strong>: the set or population</p>
        <p>In mathematics, there are n! ways to arrange n objects in sequence. "The factorial n! gives the number of ways in which n objects can be permuted."</p>

        <p>For example:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>2 factorial:</strong> 2! = 2 × 1 = 2<br>
            There are 2 different ways to arrange the numbers 1 through 2: {1, 2} and {2, 1}.</li>
            <li><strong>4 factorial:</strong> 4! = 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 24<br>
            There are 24 different ways to arrange the numbers 1 through 4.</li>
            <li><strong>5 factorial:</strong> 5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120</li>
            <li><strong>0 factorial:</strong> 0! = 1<br>
            There is exactly 1 way to arrange 0 objects.</li>
        </ul>
